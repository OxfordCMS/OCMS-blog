## Exectuve Summary
This pilot study is a follow-up on the <a href="/OCMS-blog/white_paper/Comparison-of-DNA-Extraction-Methods">Comparison of DNA Extraction Methods</a>

The ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard is comprised of 10 microbes in known quantities. The Community Standard was diluted from neat to 1:1000000 to determine at what point the extracted DNA was no longer detected by Nanodrop analysis.
DNA extracted using the optimum homogenisation method and preferred extraction kit, identified in DNA extraction methods pilot study, was used. At the dilutions 1:100 to 1:1000000, DNA concentrations were recorded as being low. 16S amplification and library preparation was performed on these samples using the YouSeq NGS 16S kit.
Products of the 16S amplification ran on a gel showed a DNA band down to a dilution of 1:100000, indicating that very low input DNA could still be amplified and detected with 16S PCR. This library was then pooled and sequenced. Sequencing of the pooled library revealed that all of the microbes within all dilutions of the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard could be detected at the genus level. Further, only a decrease in percentage of reads was observed at dilutions of 1:100000 and 1:1000000. The PCR no template control showed no reads assigned to that sample, while the kit only control showed some low-level contamination, indicating some potential experimental contamination, either environmental or cross.

## Objective
Determine the lowest concentration of DNA required for 16S rRNA gene analysis.

## Aims
* Understand at which dilution of the serially diluted community standard, the Nanodrop no longer detects DNA and if diluting the standards affects which species within the standard are detected.  
* Establish a 16S library preparation protocol using a commercially available kit and determine if the amplification of the low concentration DNA samples will allow detection of the all community standard species in the correct abundance.

## 16S Library Preparation Methodology
To determine if the diluted samples with low DNA concentrations (1:100 to 1:1000000 dilution) could be amplified to detect signal, 16S PCR amplification was performed on the samples extracted by the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit with the Qiagen Vortex Adapter (see <a href="/OCMS-blog/white_paper/Comparison-of-DNA-Extraction-Methods">Comparison of DNA Extraction Methods</a>) using the YouSeq 16S NGS Library preparation kit ([figure 1](#figure1)).

**Figure 1. 16S experimental workflow**

The Qiagen Vortex Adapter was selected as the homogenisation step as it had shown the best results from the shotgun sequencing of the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard. The type extraction kit had shown no significant difference in sequencing output and the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep kit was selected (see <a href="/OCMS-blog/white_paper/Comparison-of-DNA-Extraction-Methods">Comparison of DNA Extraction Methods</a>).
Samples which had shown low DNA concentrations by Nanodrop analysis were selected for 16S amplification and sequencing. A diluent only control (PBS), which was ran through the extraction process, was included as a control for extraction kit contaminants. The ZymoBIOMICS Microbial DNA Standard (#D6305) consists of DNA extracted by Zymo Research from the same Community Standard and served as a 16S PCR positive control. dH2O was used as a no sample negative control for the 16S PCR reaction.


## Results
### 16S Library Preparation

#### PCR band detection
The two-step PCR process was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, PCR reaction 1 amplifies the 16S region and PCR reaction 2 adds the unique adapter/indexes to the amplified sequences for pooling. Prior to PCR reaction 2 and pooling, the remaining sample from PCR reaction 1 was ran on a 1% agarose gel to determine if a single DNA product was amplified and if low concentrations of DNA could be detected following amplification.
The agarose gel showed that a single PCR product was detected, indicating no non-specific products were generated by the PCR reaction. Sample dilutions of 1:100 to 1:100000, where DNA had not previously been detected above baseline by Nanodrop, showed a single band following 16S PCR amplification. Although still detectable, the band intensity decreased with increasing dilution and no band was detectable at 1:1000000 dilution ([figure 2](#figure2)). Both the PBS kit control and the PCR water control showed no band, indicating no contamination from either the extraction kit components or PCR kit components respectively. A single band was detected in the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial DNA standard lane ([figure 2](#figure2)).

#### YouSeq The One™ 16S NGS kit
YouSeq subsequently updated the 16S library preparation kit to incorporate the 16S amplification and the barcoding into one qPCR protocol (The One™ 16S NGS kit). The samples outlined used above were ran again using The One™ 16S NGS kit’s instructions. Relative ratios were calculated from the qPCR ct values as described in the protocol and samples pooled as outlined in [table 1](#table1).

Pooled samples were shipped to YouSeq for Illumina sequencing.

### 16S Sequencing Analysis
Samples were processed through the Dada2 pipeline and standard analysis by Nick Ilott. Quality of raw sequencing data was assessed using FastQC (v0.11.07). Following quality assessment, downstream processing was performed using dada2 (PMID:27214047) which was implemented in pipeline_dada2.py from the (<a href="https://github.com/nickilott/NGSKit">NGSKit repository></a>). Given the drop in quality at ~200bp, it was decided to proceed with the analysis using the first read in the pair (V3 region). The filterAndTrim function in dada2 was used to truncate the reads to 200bp. Retained primer sequences were removed from reads (17bp) which resulted in final read lengths of 183bp. Error learning, de-replication and sample inference were performed using dada2 with default parameters. Taxonomy was assigned to amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) using the assignTaxonomy function in dada2 and the (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/2541239/files/RefSeq-RDP16S_v2_May2018.fa.gz">NCBI RefSeq training data></a>).

16S was only reliable up to the Genus level. 16S abundance is also different for the different bacterial species within the ZymoBIOMICS Community Standard, and therefore the expected abundance is different compared to shotgun metagenomic sequencing ([Table 2](#table2_anchor)).
All 8 genera of bacteria were recovered from the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial DNA standard and the serial dilution of the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standards ([figure 3](#figure3)). The most striking observation from the 16S sequencing analysis, was at dilutions of 1:100000 and 1:1000000, the % reads began to decrease, although all genera were still detected. Where a band was not detected in the agarose gel at 1:1000000 ([figure 2](#figure2)), the full complement of microbes was observed by sequencing.
The 16S PCR no template control showed no reads assigned to that sample, indicating no contamination was introduced at the PCR stage ([figure 3](#figure3)). However, the kit control, where only PBS had been processed through the DNA extraction kit, showed low levels of reads (~15%) assigned to 4 different genera ([figure 3](#figure3)). The dada2 pipeline only identifies microbes within the standard and is not configured to identify non-microbial community standard contamination. The presence of these 4 genera within the kit control sample indicates that the ZymoBIOMICS DNA Microprep Kit may potentially contribute contaminates, which can be detected by 16S PCR amplification. Equally, it cannot be ruled out that cross contamination from the lower dilutions of standard itself could have contaminated this control. The configuration of the data2 pipeline means the presence of contamination is likely an underestimate, as unassigned genera are not identified.
The analysis of the 16S sequencing data showed that Lactobacillus fermentum showed a relatively low abundance in all samples including the DNA standard, despite having the largest predicted 16S rRNA abundance ([Table 2](#table2_anchor) and [figure 3](#figure3)). This may indicate that Lactobacillus is difficult to extract, amplify or detect at lower concentrations by 16S sequencing, as the shotgun metagenomic sequencing showed a good recovery of Lactobacillus fermentum (see <a href="/OCMS-blog/white_paper/Comparison-of-DNA-Extraction-Methods">Comparison of DNA Extraction Methods</a>).

## Summary
*	Products of the 16S amplification ran on a gel showed that samples with low DNA concentrations, by Nanodrop analysis, can be amplified to detect DNA bands down to a 1:100000 dilution of a simply microbial community.
*	No bands were detected in the PBS only kit control or the no template control of the 16S PCR reaction.
*	16S sequencing of the pooled library revealed that all of the microbes within all dilutions of the ZymoBIOMICS Microbial Community Standard could be detected at the genus level.
*	Sample dilutions of 1:100000 and 1:1000000 showed decreased percentage of reads however, all microbes were still present.
*	No reads were assigned PCR no template control, while the PBS kit only control showed some low-level contamination, indicating some potential experimental contamination, either environmental or cross.
